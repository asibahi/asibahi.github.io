This is a series of articles I wrote while writing [`paella`](https://github.com/asibahi/paella), following Nora Sandler's [Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/2022/03/29/Write-a-C-Compiler-the-Book.html). It was both an exercise to learn Zig and a way to waste time instead of looking for work, as I am currently "between jobs". I did not edit them as I collect them here outside of fixing some broken links.
