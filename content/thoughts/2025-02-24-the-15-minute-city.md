Note: this is a draft socument .the ideas are haphazard and not properly organized.

The cities of Syria are, to put it lightly, in bad shape. Decades of neglect followed by the war and [large-scale destruction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/destruction-of-aleppo/) have destroyed the cities. Everyone in Syria wants to rebuild, but we need to re-build it *right*. We should build them for humans.

But cities should be designed for humans. Humans should be able to walk the streets safely and freely. Chuldren should be able to run and play. Women with strollers and the elderlies with canes and disabled with wheelchairs should be able to get around. Our environment should pleaze our senses.

Unfortunately, modern cities are designed first and foremost for cars. Streets are made for cars, and humans walking around are merely a necessity. Car pollute our enivornment with noise and smells and eye-sores. Our children cannot walk safely on streets. All the pavements and asphalt makes it difficult to walk around with a stroller (seriously, try it one day.)

But it does not have to be this way. We can use this opportunity to build our cities and streets again to cater for living things. The idea has many names in Academia and Practice. You'll often see it called [Humanization](https://stories.undp.org/humanizing-cities), or the [15-minute City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15-minute_city). The theory behind these concepts are entirely uncotroversial among academics and practioners, but where they stumble is often in convincing policy makers (which brings about all the brand names).

## The Real Problem with Cars

Cars are often brought up as a major contributor to air pollution and global warming. And the solution, very often, is posited as enviironmentally friendly cars, or (in case of Syria) newer less polluting cars. Another usual suggested solution is to mandate [carpools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool), or [odd-even rationing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddâ€“even_rationing) or [widening roads at the expense of all else](https://apnews.com/article/egypt-cemetery-highways-cairo-city-dead-4b14e617e154fec1ec2dc34f5890d2c9).But all that is just kicking the can down the road instead of picking it up.

Cars inside cities are terrible as a *concept*. They are the absolute worst, least efficient way, to move people around a city (second only to a boat, perhaps.)

To illustrate the point, I invite you to watch [this old car commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_oWmY_mkCA). Note how *empty* the world looks, with all that space that is taken away by cars could be instead used for pavements and trees and shops and housing and other humans. The ad is mwant, ironically, to advertise cars; but it only shows how ridiculous they are.

![humans and how much cards they need](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8mgL-we3qQpMU7Uzf73fRdkfNggoHTbwDSIig6AT4BMB0jZqEXaEk3RVABFrlGv0Y0YGB1K4W2eoxQRG2m6QjS0UbzHX2TUmulYnq30ADeGXFRfrsoSU4ThGRkemA50g33UsNhI)

The irony of this is a self reinforcing cycle. The more cars you have, the more space you need of car infrastructure, the less space there is for actual useful humans things, the further everything is, the more you need cars.

Imagine all the additional space you could have in your city if there just was not any cars?

## So Why are Cities not Changing?

Unfortunately, policy makers are generally very resistant to city humanization policies. There are many rational (and irrational) reasons for that. People do not like change. And people *love* their cars. Most importantly, infrastructure is expensive, and decades of sunk costs reinforce these positions. The solutions require maintenance and long term policy commitments.

However, many cities world wide are breaking the vicious cycle and lessening, one by one, their dependency on cars.

Riyadh,
Boston,
London

failures

Cairo
London?

What does this have to do wth Syria?

in Syria, the silverlining is that the bandaid is already ripped off. The infrastrudtcure is destroyed. There is no sunk cost any more. But we need to start planning now.
