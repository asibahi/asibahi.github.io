This is two things:

1. A practical application and exploration of the ideas discussed on [Practical Arabic Justification](@/thoughts/Practical%20Arabic%20Justification/index.md)
2. Printed art pieces to give to family, friends, and clients.

There are multiple examples in the [Github repo](https://github.com/asibahi/nun/tree/master)

I first posted about this on [typo.social](https://typo.social/@asibahi/112218937752254578).

Born out of this project is my first (serious) Rust crate: [`kashida`](https://docs.rs/kashida/latest/kashida/)
